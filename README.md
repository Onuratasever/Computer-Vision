📌 Learning Keypoint Detectors and Descriptors Using OpenCV Pseudo-Labels
This project implements a deep learning–based keypoint detector and descriptor extractor trained using pseudo-labels generated by classical OpenCV methods (SIFT). Inspired by SuperPoint, the model learns both keypoint locations and corresponding descriptors in a single forward pass and is evaluated on the Middlebury stereo dataset.
📷 Project Overview
Traditional feature detectors (SIFT, ORB, FAST) are hand-engineered and reliable but not learnable.
This project explores whether a deep network can learn:
Where to detect keypoints
How to generate descriptors
Using only weak supervision from OpenCV pseudo-labels
The model is trained on the RGB-D Object Dataset and evaluated on stereo matching tasks, comparing it against SIFT.
